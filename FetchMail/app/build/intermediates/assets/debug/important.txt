Meet the inbox

Gmail's inbox sorts your email into categories so you can see what's new at
a glance, decide which emails you want to read when and view similar types
of emails together. Watch the video
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFf7dlewJus>

Choose your categories

The Social and Promotions categories are on by default. Add categories like
Updates and Forums or remove categories to have those emails show up in
your Primary inbox. Learn how to choose categories
<https://support.google.com/mail/?hl=en&p=inboxcategories_all>

Customize your inbox

If you see a message you want in a different category, you can move it
there. On mobile devices, you can even choose which categories create a
notification. More customization tips

Hi tusher,




I am contacting as you recently joined HackerEarth but it seems that you haven't been able to spend much time on the platform.




I am hoping to better understand why, because we are working right now to make it easier for developers to get started. Can you respond and tell me how we can make the journey easier for a programmer?




I know you are busy but I am sure you will come back and start coding with us. Just to mention, there are 3 major areas from where you can start - by Practicing problems, Compete with developers &amp; participate in Hackathons.

Hi there,

One rite of passage for all programmers is to build and deploy your first web application. If a fear of programming is holding you back from taking the plunge, you're not alone.

In a study at the University of Cape Town, researchers found that students often used words such as "anxiety", "panic", "nightmare", and "stress" to describe their feelings about programming.*

Codecademy co-founders Ryan and Zach recognized this problem in 2011 when they set out to teach the world how to code. Now more than six years and tens of millions of users later, Codecademy is going further than ever to help people learn the skills they need to earn high paying jobs — without the horror that has plagued learners for years.

Our new Pro Intensive Build Front-End Web Apps ( https://www.codecademy.com/pro/intensive/build-frontend-web-apps-from-scratch?utm_source=customer_io&utm_campaign=bwa_m_minus_10_31_17&utm_medium=email&utm_term=a&utm_content=inline_link ) teaches you all the skills and tools you need to go from zero front-end web development experience to making beautiful web applications in just 8 weeks. Plus, our team of Codecademy Pro Advisors is available to answer your questions immediately via live chat if you get stuck.

So, are you ready to conquer your fear of building a web application? Enroll today to secure your seat in our next cohort of Build Front-End Web Apps ( https://www.codecademy.com/pro/intensive/build-frontend-web-apps-from-scratch?utm_source=customer_io&utm_campaign=bwa_m_minus_10_31_17&utm_medium=email&utm_term=a&utm_content=inline_link ) that begins on October 31st:

Hi there!

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use OpenCV to perform
face recognition ( http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiMzczODQ4NTM3NiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTgvMDkvMjQvb3BlbmN2LWZhY2UtcmVjb2duaXRpb24vP19fcz1paHlubjZxYm1meTYxYXF0emdwciJ9 ) which is actually different than the dlib-based face
recognition system we built back in June.

Today’s tutorial is also a special gift for my fiance?e, Trisha,
who is now officially my wife! Our wedding was over the weekend,
and by the time you’re reading this blog post, we’ll be at the
airport preparing to board our flight for the honeymoon:

Image ( http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiMzczODQ4NTM3NiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTgvMDkvMjQvb3BlbmN2LWZhY2UtcmVjb2duaXRpb24vP19fcz1paHlubjZxYm1meTYxYXF0emdwciJ9 )

To celebrate the occasion, and show her how much her support of
myself, the PyImageSearch blog, and the PyImageSearch community
means to me, I decided to use OpenCV to perform face recognition
on a dataset of our faces.

You can swap in your own dataset of faces of course! All you need
to do is follow my directory structure in insert your own face
images.

As a bonus, I’ve also included how to label “unknown” faces that
cannot be classified with sufficient confidence.

To learn how to perform OpenCV face recognition in your own
applications, be sure to read the full tutorial! ( http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiMzczODQ4NTM3NiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTgvMDkvMjQvb3BlbmN2LWZhY2UtcmVjb2duaXRpb24vP19fcz1paHlubjZxYm1meTYxYXF0emdwciJ9 )

P.S. I don't take off work very often, but I promised Trisha that
I would spend the next two weeks present with her. During our
honeymoon I don't plan to be online often, and ideally, I won't
be online at all. Feel free to email me of course, but I (1) ask
that you kindly respect Trisha and I's desire to disconnect
during our honeymoon and (2) be patient with my reply. I will
certainly reply to you when I am back during the week of October
8th.

That said, even though I'll be offline the next two weeks, I took
the time to write blog posts and tutorials that will go out every
Monday while I'm gone! Even though I won't be online much, I
still wanted to ensure you could study and learn while I was
gone ?

Enjoy the posts and I'll chat with you when I am back.

OpenCV Face Recognition [plus I got married over the weekend! ??]
Hi,

If you’ve been paying attention to my Twitter account lately,
you’ve probably seen a few teasers of what I’ve been working on
-- a Python framework to rapidly construct object detectors.

Image ( http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiMzc0NDk0OTIwMiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTQvMTEvMTAvaGlzdG9ncmFtLW9yaWVudGVkLWdyYWRpZW50cy1vYmplY3QtZGV0ZWN0aW9uLz9fX3M9aWh5bm42cWJtZnk2MWFxdHpncHIifQ )

From faces ( http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiMzc0NDk0OTIwMiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vdHdpdHRlci5jb20vUHlJbWFnZVNlYXJjaC9zdGF0dXMvNTIzMTk3NTAxMTgxMjcyMDY0P19fcz1paHlubjZxYm1meTYxYXF0emdwciJ9 ),
to license plates ( http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiMzc0NDk0OTIwMiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vdHdpdHRlci5jb20vUHlJbWFnZVNlYXJjaC9zdGF0dXMvNTIwMzU2NTYyMDY2NzUxNDg4P19fcz1paHlubjZxYm1meTYxYXF0emdwciJ9 ),
to beer bottles ( http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiMzc0NDk0OTIwMiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vdHdpdHRlci5jb20vUHlJbWFnZVNlYXJjaC9zdGF0dXMvNTIzNTE2NjUzMjM4NDg0OTkyP19fcz1paHlubjZxYm1meTYxYXF0emdwciJ9 ) --
this 6 Step framework can be utilized to detect and recognize
objects in images with ease.

The reason I started working on this framework is because I
really can’t stand the Haar cascade classifiers provided by
OpenCV (i.e. the Viola-Jones detectors). While cascade methods
are extremely fast, they leave much to be desired, especially
regarding training time and false-positive detections.

There is also the problem that the Viola-Jones detectors are
nearing 15 years old. If this detector were a nice bottle of
Cabernet Sauvignon, I might be pretty stoked right now. But the
field has advanced substantially since then.

And after reading this post, you’ll have a good high-level grasp
on the steps required to build your own custom object detectors.

Ready? Let’s get started. ( http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiMzc0NDk0OTIwMiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTQvMTEvMTAvaGlzdG9ncmFtLW9yaWVudGVkLWdyYWRpZW50cy1vYmplY3QtZGV0ZWN0aW9uLz9fX3M9aWh5bm42cWJtZnk2MWFxdHpncHIifQ )

How to find datasets in data.world

Hi tushar1404116,

Search thousands of open datasets from government agencies, academia and the open data community on data.world. Beyond simple text search, you can try searching by:

- column header - column:zip (https://page.data.world/e2t/sc2/Mm-nFbkhmSNW5TL9xp8g_kSqW6V-2ST5Vpk_dW69sPLz6vBMt_f1CYJMH13 )
- dataset tag - tag:twitter (https://page.data.world/e2t/sc2/Mm-nFbkhmSNW5TL9xp8g_kSqW6V-2ST5Vpk_dW69sPLz6vBMt_f1CYJMH23 )
- file extension - extension:xml (https://page.data.world/e2t/sc2/Mm-nFbkhmSNW5TL9xp8g_kSqW6V-2ST5Vpk_dW69sPLz6vBMt_f1CYJMH33 )

You can directly search data.world from the Chrome search bar by entering “data.world” in the URL bar and then pressing the space bar or the tab key. Afterwards, whatever you input in the URL bar will search data.world.

Lastly, check out your personalized activity feed for trending and relevant data, and to stay current on your data projects and topics of interest.

Explore your activity feed! (https://page.data.world/e2t/sc2/Mm-nFbkhmSNW5TL9xp8g_kSqW6V-2ST5Vpk_dW69sPLz6vBMt_f1CYJMH43 )

It all starts with a question... what's yours?
Hi,

Whenever you spend 9 months planning a big event, whether it's a
wedding or a conference, you need a post-mortem. A time to
reflect on what went well...and on things you would improve on
the next go around.

Today's blog post is my post-mortem on the first ever PyImageConf
2018, ( http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiMzgxNjQzODM4MCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTgvMTAvMDEvcHlpbWFnZWNvbmYtMjAxOC1yZWNhcC8_X19zPWloeW5uNnFibWZ5NjFhcXR6Z3ByIn0 ) PyImageSearch’s very own computer vision and deep learning
education conference which took place August 26th-28th in San
Francisco, CA:

Image ( http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiMzgxNjQzODM4MCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTgvMTAvMDEvcHlpbWFnZWNvbmYtMjAxOC1yZWNhcC8_X19zPWloeW5uNnFibWZ5NjFhcXR6Z3ByIn0 )

It was an amazing conference and based on attendee feedback, it
was HUGE success.

Douglas Jones, a PyImageConf attendee had this to share in his
post-conference survey:

"A huge shout out to Adrian and everyone who worked so diligently
to put on on of the BEST conferences I have ever attended. A
wonderfully small and intimate conference where you really could
talk to the presenters and ask questions. The other big plus of a
small conference is you have many more opportunities to meet
fellow practitioners and share ideas, tip and tricks. It is easy
to meet someone who faced the same stumbling block and can help
you , or you have something to share from your experiences. If
you missed this PyImageConf, I am sorry, you really missed
something. If there is another, don’t miss it!"

Of course, not everything was perfect and there is always room
for improvement.

To read my recap on the conference, and get a peak behind the
curtain so to speak, you'll need to read the blog post. ( http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiMzgxNjQzODM4MCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTgvMTAvMDEvcHlpbWFnZWNvbmYtMjAxOC1yZWNhcC8_X19zPWloeW5uNnFibWZ5NjFhcXR6Z3ByIn0 )

PyImageConf: Things that ROCKED and things that could have been better.
"That son of a bitch. I knew he took my last beer."

These are words a man should never, ever have to say. But I
muttered them to myself in an exasperated sigh of disgust as I
closed the door to my refrigerator.

After a painfully long day of working, all I wanted was an ice
cold beer. But it seemed my old friend James had (allegedly)
stolen my last brew.

So I did what any man would do.

...I built a motion detection and home surveillance system with
Python and OpenCV to catch any beer thieves that try to open my
refrigerator:

Excessive?

Perhaps.

But I take my beer seriously.

Here are this week's five links that are worth your time:

1. How to use JavaScript classes - a one-hour introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (1 hour watch): https://www.freecodecamp.org/n/9klmNCA23

Hi,

In today’s brand new tutorial, ( http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNDkzMzU0MzgyMCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTgvMTIvMzEva2VyYXMtY29udjJkLWFuZC1jb252b2x1dGlvbmFsLWxheWVycy8_X19zPWloeW5uNnFibWZ5NjFhcXR6Z3ByIn0 ) we are going to discuss the Keras Conv2D class, including the
most important parameters you need to tune when training your own
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Image ( http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNDkzMzU0MzgyMCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTgvMTIvMzEva2VyYXMtY29udjJkLWFuZC1jb252b2x1dGlvbmFsLWxheWVycy8_X19zPWloeW5uNnFibWZ5NjFhcXR6Z3ByIn0 )

The inspiration for today’s post came from PyImageSearch reader,
Danny.

Danny asks:

~~~

Hi Adrian, I’m having some trouble understanding the parameters
to Keras’ Conv2D class.

Which ones are the important ones?

Which ones should I just leave at their default values?

I’m a bit new to deep learning so I’m a bit confused on how to
choose the parameter values when creating my own CNN.

~~~

Danny asks a great question — there are quite a few parameters to
Keras’ Conv2D class. The sheer number can be a bit overwhelming
if you’re new to the world of computer vision and deep learning.

In today’s tutorial I’m going to discuss each of the parameters
to the Keras Conv2D class, explain each one, and provide examples
of situations where and when you would want to set specific
values, enabling you to:

* Quickly determine if you need to utilize a specific
parameter to the Keras Conv2D class
* Decide on a proper value for that specific parameter
* Effectively train your own Convolutional Neural Network

Overall, my goal is to help reduce any confusion, anxiety, or
frustration when using Keras’ Conv2D class. After going through
this tutorial you will have a strong understanding of the Keras
Conv2D parameters.

To learn more about the Keras Conv2D class and convolutional
layers, including my tips, suggestions, and best practices, just

https://bit.ly/2tgVXEFBangladesh ahead of all, shows Spectator Index on per capita GDP growth

Bangladesh equalled China and India to log in the highest per capita economic growth globally in the last five years, according to The Spectator Index. The country's per capita growth was 45 percent in the past five years in terms of purchasing power parity, which is the same as neighbouring India and China, reported the index on its Twitter account recently. The index -- which is run by The Spectator, a weekly British magazine focused on politics, economics, history, military affairs, sports, science, and technology -- also compared Bangladesh's economy with that of Venezuela to show how much the South Asian nation has progressed over the years. In 1980, the size of Venezuela's economy was $117 billion in PPP terms compared to Bangladesh's $41 billion. In 2018, the gross domestic product of Venezuela stood at $330 billion, whereas it was $751 billion for Bangladesh.

Bangladesh HPM Sheikh Hasina outlines agenda for future Bangladesh https://bit.ly/2NiPuCt

Ina recent interview with Deutsche Welle (DW), the Germany's public international broadcaster, Honourable Prime Minister (HPM) Sheikh Hasina has stated that Bangladesh has made rapid economic progress under her watch in past ten years and is now moving toward being classified as a lower- to middle-income country. Over the past several years, the economy has been growing at an average of 6% to 7% annually, trade volume has multiplied and foreign investment has gone up. Responding to a question as regards to countering the threat of terrorism, the Bangladesh Premier said "Of course not. What I have done is done and it will continue.” On the sheltering of Rohingya refugees in her country, she said “We do not want to fight with Myanmar. We are also trying to cooperate with China and India. But the pressure is increasing on Bangladesh.” She has hinted that her present -- and third consecutive -- term could possibly be her last as prime minister, adding that she wanted to create room for younger leaders.

tusher, your new Huawei HUAWEI Y9 2018 doesn't have the latest Google apps
Hi,

Today is a big day — I’m formally announcing that I’m writing a
brand new book on Computer Vision with the Raspberry Pi.

I’ve been wanting to write this book for years, arguably ever
since I started playing around with the Raspberry Pi and OpenCV.

But the timing never worked out quite right.

I was either:

* Wrapping up other books or courses
* Busy with existing projects that needed to be completed
* Pulled in too many directions at once, not having the mental
bandwidth and capacity to work with both the Raspberry Pi
hardware and Computer Vision software at the same time

But deep down I wanted to write this book and make it come to
life.

On my yearly retreat in late 2018/early 2019 the stars aligned. I
looked at my project plans, my commitments for the year, and took
stock of my mental bandwidth. All three were a “go” — I decided
the Raspberry Pi + Computer Vision book would be written and
published in 2019.

Since that decision, myself and the PyImageSearch team have been
writing code and putting together projects for the book.

We’ve put together code for chapters that will enable you to:

* Build practical, real-world computer vision applications on the
Raspberry Pi
* Create Computer Vision and Internet of Things (IoT) projects
and applications with the Raspberry Pi
* Optimize your OpenCV code and algorithms on the resource
constrained Pi
* Perform Deep Learning on the Raspberry Pi (including utilizing
the Movidius NCS and OpenVINO toolkit)
* Create self-driving car applications with a Raspberry Pi

But before I can publish the book, I need your help first…

In the rest of this email I’ve included a rough sketch of what I
plan to cover in this Computer Vision + Raspberry Pi book.

This sketch is by no means finalized, but it does reflect what I
think is important to review/cover.

Take a look at this list of topics, then be sure to reply to this
email with your feedback/suggestions.

Of course, if you would prefer to read the official blog post
announcement, which includes everything (and more) covered in
this email, just click here.

********************************************
Raspberry Pi and Computer Vision book topics
********************************************

Here is the current rough outline/set of topics I plan on
covering inside the new Computer Vision and Raspberry Pi book.

If you have a suggestion of a topic to cover, please reply to
this email and I'll see if I can make it happen!

-----------------------------
Working with the Raspberry Pi
-----------------------------

* Why the Raspberry Pi?
* Configure your Raspberry Pi for computer vision + deep learning
(including all libraries, packages, etc.)
* Or, skip the install process and use my pre-configured Raspbian
.img file which comes with everything you need
pre-installed! Just flash the .img file and boot.
* Streamline your development process and learn how to optimally
write code on the Raspberry Pi (including suggested IDEs and
recommended settings/configurations)
* Access both your USB webcam and/or Raspberry Pi camera module
on the Pi
* Work with the NoIR camera module

* Learn how to utilize multiple cameras with the Raspberry Pi

--------------------------------------------------------
Getting Started with Computer Vision on the Raspberry Pi
--------------------------------------------------------

* Gain experience with OpenCV and your Raspberry Pi camera by
creating time lapse videos on the Pi
* Build an automatic bird feed monitor that detects when birds
are present
* Create a “delivery detector” that detects when mail has been
delivered to your mailbox

* Build an automatic prescription pill identification system (and
reduce the 1.2 million injuries and deaths each year that happen
due to taking the incorrect pill)
* Learn how to stream frames from a Raspberry Pi to your web
browser
* Pipe frames from the Raspberry Pi camera to your laptop,
desktop, or cloud instance, process the frames, and then return
the results to the Pi

------------------------------------------------------
Computer Vision and IoT projects with the Raspberry Pi
------------------------------------------------------

* Review hardware considerations and suggestions when using the
Raspberry Pi in IoT applications

Hi,

One of my favorite features of the Raspberry Pi is
the huge amount of additional hardware you can attach to it.
Whether it’s cameras, temperature sensors,
gyroscopes/accelerometers, or even touch sensors, the community
surrounding the Raspberry Pi has enabled it to accomplish nearly
anything.

But one of my favorite add-ons to the Raspberry Pi is the pan and
tilt camera (which, combined with OpenCV, can be used for object
tracking): ( http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNTk4OTQzOTE5MyIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTkvMDQvMDEvcGFuLXRpbHQtZmFjZS10cmFja2luZy13aXRoLWEtcmFzcGJlcnJ5LXBpLWFuZC1vcGVuY3YvP19fcz1paHlubjZxYm1meTYxYXF0emdwciJ9 )

Image ( http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNTk4OTQzOTE5MyIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTkvMDQvMDEvcGFuLXRpbHQtZmFjZS10cmFja2luZy13aXRoLWEtcmFzcGJlcnJ5LXBpLWFuZC1vcGVuY3YvP19fcz1paHlubjZxYm1meTYxYXF0emdwciJ9 )

Using two servos, this add-on enables our camera to move
left-to-right and up-and-down simultaneously, allowing us to
detect and track objects, even if they were to go “out of frame”
(as would happen if an object approached the boundaries of a
frame with a traditional camera).

Today we are going to use the pan and tilt camera for object
tracking and more specifically, face tracking.

To learn how to perform pan and tilt object tracking/face
tracking, you'll need to read the full tutorial here!

The Tough Dash, Apr 2019
Hey there

Every few years we see a big explosion in a new technology,
technique or algorithm:

* In the mid-90s Cortes and Vapnik published their seminal work
on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) which for many years were
considered the "gold standard" of machine learning.
* Ensemble methods, especially Random Forests, were all the rage
in early and mid-2000s through the work of Thomas Dietterich, Leo
Brieman, and many others.
* The publication of AlexNet by Krizhevsky et al. in 2012 marked
the dawn of the latest incarnation of Deep Learning and Neural
Networks.

We're now closing in on 2020, the start of a new decade, and it's
only natural to wonder:

What's next?

What will the 2020s have in store for us? New algorithms? New
techniques? An entirely different breed of computer vision and
machine learning we've never seen before?

All of those are possible, and in some cases, inevitable.

But you know what I believe the next BIG thing in CV and DL to
be?

*Drum roll please*

I believe the next BIG thing in Computer Vision and Deep Learning
will be embedded smart devices, specifically Internet of
Things (IoT) devices.

Take a second to consider what we've seen in the past year:
* The Raspberry Pi is more popular than ever due to the cheap
board, reasonable specs, and small form factor.
* Intel's Movidius team has released V2 of their popular Neural
Compute Compute Stick (NCS).
* Google has started shipping Google Coral, their own single
board and USB accelerator for AI and DL.
* And just a couple weeks ago at GTC 2019, NVIDIA announced
the Jetson Nano, what many consider to be the $99 "Raspberry Pi
for Artificial Intelligence".

These single board CV and DL trends tell me three things:

* There is a huge need for not only IoT devices, but smart IoT
devices capable of leveraging CV and DL.

* This need is so strong that the large tech giant companies are
competing with each other through their own single board
machines.
* And perhaps most importantly, in the near future, a computer
scientist without at least some knowledge of AI, DL, CV will be
like an engineer without basic programming skills — potentially
unemployable and overlooked for new job opportunities, research
grants, and projects.

If you think "unemployable" is an exaggeration, I have news for
you, it's already happening.

Back in 2018, at both Google IO and Microsoft Build
(two developer conferences, mind you) Microsoft presented their
new AI/CV cameras while Google showed off their new AI voice
assistant, seemingly passing the Turing test.

Let me again remind you — these were developer conferences, not
AI conferences!

So, why am I telling you this?

To quote Louis Pasteur, "Fortune favors the prepared mind."

I want you to be prepared.

Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning all
follow trends and waves.

Embedded CV and DL is the next big wave. It's so big that it may
even be a tsunami — will you be riding that wave?

Honestly, I know I will be.

Will you join me?

To help you get your start in embedded Computer Vision and Deep
Learning, I have decided to write a brand new book — Raspberry Pi
for Computer Vision.

Inside this book you'll learn how to:

* Build practical, real-world computer vision applications on the
Pi
* Create computer vision and Internet of Things (IoT) projects
and applications with the RPi
* Optimize your OpenCV code and algorithms on the resource
constrained Pi
* Perform Deep Learning on the Raspberry Pi (including utilizing
the Movidius NCS and OpenVINO toolkit)
* Create self-driving car applications with a Pi

I also have chapters in the works for:

* Google's Coral
* NVIDIA's Jetson Nano

To help fund creating the rest of the book, I'll be launching a
Kickstarter campaign on Wednesday, April 10th at 10:00AM EST.

I hope you'll join me in backing this project and
making Raspberry Pi for Computer Vision the best possible
embedded CV and DL book available today. Let me help prepare YOU
for the next big wave in CV and DL.

I'll be back with more details on the Kickstarter campaign
tomorrow.

See you then!

Hi there,

Today I'm super happy to share a brand new tutorial on streaming
live video over a network with OpenCV, ImageZMQ, and Raspberry
Pis: ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNjE2NjA0MDY3MyIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTkvMDQvMTUvbGl2ZS12aWRlby1zdHJlYW1pbmctb3Zlci1uZXR3b3JrLXdpdGgtb3BlbmN2LWFuZC1pbWFnZXptcS8_X19zPWloeW5uNnFibWZ5NjFhcXR6Z3ByIn0 )

Every week or so I receive a comment on a blog post or a question
over email that goes something like this:

~~~

Hi Adrian, I’m working on a project where I need to stream frames
from a client camera to a server for processing using OpenCV.
Should I use an IP camera? Would a Raspberry Pi work? What about
RTSP streaming? Have you tried using FFMPEG or GStreamer? How do
you suggest I approach the problem?

~~~

It’s a great question — and if you’ve ever attempted live video
streaming with OpenCV then you know there are a ton of different
options.

You could go with the IP camera route. But IP cameras can be a
pain to work with. Some IP cameras don’t even allow you to access
the RTSP (Real-time Streaming Protocol) stream. Other IP cameras
simply don’t work with OpenCV’s 'cv2.VideoCapture' function. An
IP camera may be too expensive for your budget as well.

In those cases, you are left with using a standard webcam — the
question then becomes, how do you stream the frames from that
webcam using OpenCV?

Using FFMPEG or GStreamer is definitely an option. But both of
those can be a royal pain to work with.

Today I am going to show you my preferred solution using message
passing libraries, specifically ZMQ and ImageZMQ, the latter of
which was developed by PyImageConf 2018 speaker, Jeff Bass. Jeff
has put a ton of work into ImageZMQ and his efforts really shows.

As you’ll see, this method of OpenCV video streaming is not
only reliable but incredibly easy to use, requiring only a few
lines of code.

To learn how to perform live network video streaming with OpenCV,
just keep reading the full post here!

Hi,

Earlier this week I shared a tutorial on using OpenCV to stream
live video over a network ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNjE5NjUyNTQ2OCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTkvMDQvMTUvbGl2ZS12aWRlby1zdHJlYW1pbmctb3Zlci1uZXR3b3JrLXdpdGgtb3BlbmN2LWFuZC1pbWFnZXptcS8_X19zPWloeW5uNnFibWZ5NjFhcXR6Z3ByIn0 ) via ImageZMQ — and today I’m pleased to share an interview with
Jeff Bass, the creator of ImageZMQ! ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNjE5NjUyNTQ2OCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTkvMDQvMTcvYW4taW50ZXJ2aWV3LXdpdGgtamVmZi1iYXNzLWNyZWF0b3Itb2YtaW1hZ2V6bXEvP19fcz1paHlubjZxYm1meTYxYXF0emdwciJ9 )

Jeff has over 40 years experience hacking with computers and
electronics — and now he’s applying computer vision + Raspberry
Pis to his permaculture farm for:

* Data collection
* Wildlife monitoring
* Water meter and temperature reading

Jeff is truly one of my favorite people that I’ve ever had the
honor to meet. Over his 40 year career he’s amassed an incredible
amount of knowledge over computer science, electronics,
statistics, and more. He also spent 20 years doing statistics and
data analysis at a large biotech company.

The advice and guidance he gives in this interview is practical,
to the point, and very well said. It’s a privilege to have him
here today.

On a personal note, Jeff was also one of
the original PyImageSearch Gurus course ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNjE5NjUyNTQ2OCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tL3B5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2gtZ3VydXMvP19fcz1paHlubjZxYm1meTYxYXF0emdwciJ9 ) members.
He’s been a long-time reader and supporter — and
he’s truly helped make this blog possible.

It’s a wonderful pleasure to have Jeff here today, and whether
you’re looking for unique, practical applications of computer
vision, OpenCV, and RPis, or simply looking for advice on how to
build your portfolio for a career in computer science or computer
vision, look no further than this interview!

P.S. Did you know that Jeff has gone through all of my books and
courses? Using the knowledge he gained from them he was able to
build the ImageZMQ library and apply practical use cases of
computer vision throughout his farm. It's truly amazing what can
be accomplished with a bit of education, some creativity, and a
drive to solve problems.

Are you interested in applying computer vision in creative ways
to your own projects? If so, I suggest you invest in your
education now and consider going through my books/courses:
* Practical Python and OpenCV ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNjE5NjUyNTQ2OCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tL3ByYWN0aWNhbC1weXRob24tb3BlbmN2Lz9fX3M9aWh5bm42cWJtZnk2MWFxdHpncHIifQ ) - Gentle
intro to the world of computer vision and image processing
through the OpenCV library.
* PyImageSearch Gurus Course ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNjE5NjUyNTQ2OCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tL3B5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2gtZ3VydXMvP19fcz1paHlubjZxYm1meTYxYXF0emdwciJ9 ) - Similar to
a college level survey course in computer vision
but much more hands-on and practical.

* Deep Learning for Computer Vision ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNjE5NjUyNTQ2OCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tL2RlZXAtbGVhcm5pbmctY29tcHV0ZXItdmlzaW9uLXB5dGhvbi1ib29rLz9fX3M9aWh5bm42cWJtZnk2MWFxdHpncHIifQ ) - Deep dive into the world of computer vision and deep
learning. If you want to study deep learning in-depth, go with
this book.

And the best news? All three are currently on sale now inside the
Raspberry Pi for Computer Vision Kickstarter campaign. ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNjE5NjUyNTQ2OCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtpY2tzdGFydGVyLmNvbS9wcm9qZWN0cy9hZHJpYW5yb3NlYnJvY2svcmFzcGJlcnJ5LXBpLWZvci1jb21wdXRlci12aXNpb24tZWJvb2s_X19zPWloeW5uNnFibWZ5NjFhcXR6Z3ByIn0 )

But this sale won't last forever!

The free tutorials on PyImageSearch are great, but if you want a
deeper understanding of CV and DL, a guided path to mastery, and
not to mention, direct help from me, now is the time to invest in
your education.

Hi there,

Today’s tutorial is inspired from PyImageSearch reader, Joao
Paulo Folador, a PhD student from Brazil.

Joao is interested in utilizing computer vision and machine
learning to automatically detect and predict Parkinson’s disease
based on geometric drawings ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNjMzNjc1NDIxNiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTkvMDQvMjkvZGV0ZWN0aW5nLXBhcmtpbnNvbnMtZGlzZWFzZS13aXRoLW9wZW5jdi1jb21wdXRlci12aXNpb24tYW5kLXRoZS1zcGlyYWwtd2F2ZS10ZXN0Lz9fX3M9aWh5bm42cWJtZnk2MWFxdHpncHIifQ ) (i.e., spirals and sign waves).

Image ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNjMzNjc1NDIxNiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTkvMDQvMjkvZGV0ZWN0aW5nLXBhcmtpbnNvbnMtZGlzZWFzZS13aXRoLW9wZW5jdi1jb21wdXRlci12aXNpb24tYW5kLXRoZS1zcGlyYWwtd2F2ZS10ZXN0Lz9fX3M9aWh5bm42cWJtZnk2MWFxdHpncHIifQ )

While I am familiar with Parkinson’s disease, I had not heard of
the geometric drawing test — a bit of research led me to a 2017
paper, Distinguishing Different Stages of Parkinson’s Disease
Using Composite Index of Speed and Pen-Pressure of Sketching a
Spiral, by Zham et al.

The researchers found that the drawing speed was slower and the
pen pressure lower among Parkinson’s patients — this
was especially pronounced for patients with a more acute/advanced
forms of the disease.

One of the symptoms of Parkinson’s is tremors and rigidity in the
muscles, making it harder to draw smooth spirals and waves.

Joao postulated that it might be possible to detect Parkinson’s
disease using the drawings alone rather than having to measure
the speed and pressure of the pen on paper.

Reducing the requirement of tracking pen speed and pressure:

* Eliminates the need for additional hardware when performing the
test.
* Makes it far easier to automatically detect Parkinson’s.

Graciously, Joao and his advisor allowed me access to the dataset
they collected of both spirals and waves drawn by (1) patients
with Parkinson’s, and (2) healthy participants.

I took a look at the dataset and considered our options.

Originally, Joao wanted to apply deep learning to the project,
but after consideration, I carefully explained that deep
learning, while powerful, isn’t always the right tool for the
job! You wouldn’t want to use a hammer to drive in a screw, for
instance.

Instead, you look at your toolbox, carefully consider your
options, and grab the right tool for the task at hand.

I explained this to Joao and then demonstrated how we can predict
Parkinson’s in images with 83.33% accuracy using standard
computer vision and machine learning algorithms.

To see which algorithms where used, and how to apply them to
Parkinson's detection, you'll need to read the full post here. ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNjMzNjc1NDIxNiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTkvMDQvMjkvZGV0ZWN0aW5nLXBhcmtpbnNvbnMtZGlzZWFzZS13aXRoLW9wZW5jdi1jb21wdXRlci12aXNpb24tYW5kLXRoZS1zcGlyYWwtd2F2ZS10ZXN0Lz9fX3M9aWh5bm42cWJtZnk2MWFxdHpncHIifQ )

P.S. Deep learning methods are all the rage right now, and yes,
they are super powerful, but deep learning doesn’t make other
computer vision techniques obsolete.

Instead, you need to bring the right tool to the job. You
wouldn’t try to bang in a screw with a hammer, you would instead
use a screwdriver. The same concept is true with computer vision
— you bring the right tool to the job.

In order to help build your toolbox of computer vision algorithms
I have put together the PyImageSearch Gurus course. ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNjMzNjc1NDIxNiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tL3B5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2gtZ3VydXMvP19fcz1paHlubjZxYm1meTYxYXF0emdwciJ9 )

Inside the course you’ll learn:

* Machine learning and image classification
* Automatic License/Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)
* Face recognition
* How to train HOG + Linear SVM object detectors
* Content-based Image Retrieval (i.e., image search engines)
* Processing image datasets with Hadoop and MapReduce
* Hand gesture recognition
* Deep learning fundamentals
* …and much more!

PyImageSearch Gurus is the most comprehensive computer vision
education online today, covering 13 modules broken out into 168
lessons, with other 2,161 pages of content. You won’t find a more
detailed computer vision course anywhere else online, I guarantee
it.

The PyImageSearch Gurus course also includes private community
forums. I participate in the Gurus forum virtually every day, so
it’s a great way to get expert advice, both from me and from the
other advanced students, on a daily basis.

If you'd like to see the full list of topics covered in the
course (including 10 FREE sample lessons), just click here and
I'll email them to you immediately. ( http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNjMzNjc1NDIxNiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly9kcmlwLmxhL2MvZXlKaFkyTnZkVzUwWDJsa0lqb2lORGMyT0RReU9TSXNJblJ5YVdkblpYSmZhV1FpT2lJeE1UVTROekl4TXlJc0ltUjVibUZ0YVdOZmRYSnNJanB1ZFd4c0xDSjFjbXdpT2lKb2RIUndPaTh2ZDNkM0xuQjVhVzFoWjJWelpXRnlZMmd1WTI5dEwyUnZibVV0WjNWeWRYTXRkRzkxY2k4X1kyRnRjR0ZwWjI0OU9ERTVaVFpoTUdaY2RUQXdNalowYnoxMGIzVnlYMlZ0WVdsc1h6RWlmUT9fX3M9aWh5bm42cWJtZnk2MWFxdHpncHIifQ )

And if you decide you'd like to join the course, I'm offering it
at 25% OFF when you pre-order your copy of Raspberry Pi for
Computer Vision. ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNjMzNjc1NDIxNiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtpY2tzdGFydGVyLmNvbS9wcm9qZWN0cy9hZHJpYW5yb3NlYnJvY2svcmFzcGJlcnJ5LXBpLWZvci1jb21wdXRlci12aXNpb24tZWJvb2s_X19zPWloeW5uNnFibWZ5NjFhcXR6Z3ByIn0 )

A new May-be-gining
Imagine this:

You’re just hired by Yelp (a review website for businesses and
restaurants) to work in their computer vision department.

Yelp has just launched a new feature on their website that allows
reviewers to take photos of their food/dishes and then associate
them with particular items on a restaurant’s menu.

It’s a neat feature…

…but they are getting a lot of unwanted image spam.

Certain nefarious users are aren’t taking photos of their
dishes…instead, they taking photos of... (well, you can probably
guess).

Your task?

Figure out how to create an automated computer vision application
that can distinguish between “food” and “not food”, thereby
allowing Yelp to continue with their new feature launch and
provide value to their users.

So, how are you going to build such an application?

The answer lies in transfer learning via deep learning. ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNjU5MDAzOTQ5NSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTkvMDUvMjAvdHJhbnNmZXItbGVhcm5pbmctd2l0aC1rZXJhcy1hbmQtZGVlcC1sZWFybmluZy8_X19zPWloeW5uNnFibWZ5NjFhcXR6Z3ByIn0 )

Today marks the start of a brand new set of tutorials on transfer
learning using Keras. Transfer learning is the process of:

* Taking a network pre-trained on a dataset (such as ImageNet or
COCO)
* And utilizing it to recognize image/object categories it was
not trained on

Essentially, we can utilize the robust, discriminative filters
learned by state-of-the-art networks on challenging datasets, and
then apply these networks to recognize objects the model
was never trained on.

In general, there are two types of transfer learning in the
context of deep learning:
* Transfer learning via feature extraction

* Transfer learning via fine-tuning

When performing feature extraction, we treat the pre-trained
network as an arbitrary feature extractor, allowing the input
image to propagate forward, stopping at pre-specified layer, and
taking the outputs of that layer as our features.

Fine-tuning on the other hand requires that we update the model
architecture itself by removing the previous fully-connected
layer heads, providing new, freshly initialized ones, and then
training the new FC layers to predict our input classes.

We’ll be covering both techniques in this series here on the
PyImageSearch blog, but today we are going to focus on feature
extraction. ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNjU5MDAzOTQ5NSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTkvMDUvMjAvdHJhbnNmZXItbGVhcm5pbmctd2l0aC1rZXJhcy1hbmQtZGVlcC1sZWFybmluZy8_X19zPWloeW5uNnFibWZ5NjFhcXR6Z3ByIn0 )

with Keras, keep reading the full tutorial here!

P.S. If you’d like to learn more about transfer learning,
including:
* More details on the concept of transfer learning
* How to perform feature extraction
* How to fine-tune networks
* How to classify images outside your training/testing set
using both feature extraction and fine-tuning

…then you’ll definitely want to refer to my book, Deep Learning
for Computer Vision with Python ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNjU5MDAzOTQ5NSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tL2RlZXAtbGVhcm5pbmctY29tcHV0ZXItdmlzaW9uLXB5dGhvbi1ib29rLz9fX3M9aWh5bm42cWJtZnk2MWFxdHpncHIifQ ).

Besides chapters on transfer learning, you’ll also find:
* Super practical walkthroughs that present solutions to actual,
real-world image classification, object detection, and instance
segmentation problems.
* Hands-on tutorials (with lots of code) that not only show you
the algorithms behind deep learning for computer vision, but
their implementations as well.
* A no-nonsense teaching style that is guaranteed to help you
master deep learning for image understanding and visual
recognition.

To help you get a feel for the depth (and value) of the book, I'd
love to send you a PDF of the Table of Contents + FREE sample
chapters.

RE: CUET_CSE_14_Md. Ashikur Rahman Khan Tushar_CV
Hi there,

Today’s tutorial is actually a chapter for my upcoming
book, Raspberry Pi for Computer Vision ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNzA5NjY0MDEzNSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tL3Jhc3BiZXJyeS1waS1mb3ItY29tcHV0ZXItdmlzaW9uLz9fX3M9aWh5bm42cWJtZnk2MWFxdHpncHIifQ ).

As I was writing the chapter I realized that the guide wasn’t
specific to the RPi and could actually be used for anyone who
needed to configure a remote system for development (and in
particular, using the Python programming language).

Therefore, I decided to take the chapter and convert it to a blog
post. ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNzA5NjY0MDEzNSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTkvMDcvMDEvcmVtb3RlLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LW9uLXRoZS1yYXNwYmVycnktcGktb3ItYW1hem9uLWVjMi8_X19zPWloeW5uNnFibWZ5NjFhcXR6Z3ByIn0 )

Using this tutorial you will learn how to configure:

* Your Raspberry Pi for remote computer vision development
* An Amazon AWS server for remote deep learning
* …or any other system that you can connect to remotely!

To learn how to configure your Raspberry Pi, Amazon EC2 instance,
or server for remote Python development, you can keep reading the
full tutorial here! ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2ODQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNzA5NjY0MDEzNSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5aW1hZ2VzZWFyY2guY29tLzIwMTkvMDcvMDEvcmVtb3RlLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LW9uLXRoZS1yYXNwYmVycnktcGktb3ItYW1hem9uLWVjMi8_X19zPWloeW5uNnFibWZ5NjFhcXR6Z3ByIn0 )

The new budget expects the poverty rate be brought down by 10% in the next four years through a coordinated approach engaging the private sector to supplement the government’s anti-poverty initiatives. According to experts, a target has been set to take the rate down to 12.30% and the extreme poverty rate to 4.50% by 2023-24.

HPM Sheikh Hasina urged China to persuade Myanmar to take back their over one million Rohingya nationals from Bangladesh. She made the request when she had a meeting with Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Zhang Zuo at her office. According to media reports, the Premier once again expressed her firm stance over the Rohingya issue, saying that the displaced people have to go back to their homeland. In a related development, she also said Bangladesh’s security and stability may be hampered if the Rohingya refugees cannot be repatriated to Myanmar soon. She also slammed Myanmar for making excuses for delaying repatriation of the refugees though it signed three https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/pm-sheikh-hasina-says-rohingya-crisis-may-disrupt-stability-1762993 pacts with Bangladesh, pledging to complete the repatriation process within two years.

The government has taken an initiative to create 150 million jobs in the next five years to ensure employment for every eligible youth in the country. As part of the plan, as many as 100 economic zones, which were under construction across the country, would create immense opportunities for jobseekers. Such plans stand out as a testament to the government’s renewed commitment to transform the course of national progress, as envisaged by the Honourable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. In addition to this, a new horizon has been opened up for the countrymen to work abroad.

Bangladesh Awami League, under the prudent leadership of HPM Sheikh Hasina, has celebrated its 70th founding anniversary with the target to turn the country into a peaceful one by establishing good governance and balanced development. In its 70-year-long glorious history, the party gave leadership in the 1952 Language Movement and the 1971 War of Liberation, and fought successfully against exploitation, disparity and violation of basic human rights with a massive public support. 

BIDA, BEZA open One Stop Service https://www.daily-sun.com/printversion/details/401528/BIDA-BEZA-open-One-Stop-Service-

https://www.daily-sun.com/printversion/details/401528/BIDA-BEZA-open-One-Stop-Service-

Two major investment facilitating organizations, Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) and Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA) have kicked off One Stop Service (OSS) to entertain queries of the entrepreneurs. As the government is widely focusing on attracting huge volume of investment — both foreign direct investment and local investment — the full operation of OSS would help the investors start business in Bangladesh. Top officials of the government agencies, according to media reports, expressed hope that OSS would ease the difficulties of entrepreneurs and would ultimately help improve the ease of doing business index of Bangladesh.

Incentive to boost remittance transfer thru banks https://www.daily-sun.com/post/401173/2019/06/21/Incentive-to-boost-remittance-transfer-thru-banks

https://www.daily-sun.com/post/401173/2019/06/21/Incentive-to-boost-remittance-transfer-thru-banks

The government’s move to provide cash incentive on remittance transactions through the legal channel will lead a good amount of capital injection into the banking sector which has been experiencing capital shortfall in recent times, economists opined. Besides, the move has also created enthusiasm among the expatriates, a major contributor to the country’s foreign exchange reserve of $31.3 billion. In the July-April period of the current fiscal year, Bangladeshi expatriates sent $13.30 billion, which was 10% higher than the same period of the previous fiscal year, according to central bank data.
